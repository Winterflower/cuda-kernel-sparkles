# CUDA Kernel Sparkles

This is a repository to record some of my own attempts to learn about optimizing matrix multiplication on NVIDIA GPUs. 
I am mostly following the approach of Simon Boehm's approach, which is outlined [here](https://siboehm.com/articles/22/CUDA-MMM).
A lot of the code snippets have been copied from Simon's repository and slightly adapted so that they can be executed as standalone 
toy scripts on Tensara.
